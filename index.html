<p class="slightlybig">Over many years of my life I have enjoyed many forms of fictional content. These have been across many different platforms of media covering films, TV shows and comics.</p>

<h1>Movies</h1>
<p>Movies provide a major spectacle. A few hours of hard hitting emotion, action and plot can be a very fun time. Wanting to experience a story and watching and feeling it grow and lessons learnt along the way can be a very exciting experience</p>
<h2>Favourite films</h2>

<h3 class="center">The Imitation game</h3>
<img src="imitation.jpg" alt="a picture of Alan Turing and the enigma cracking team" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>Following Alan Turing making his way through a world at war and trying to crack the German Enigma code, a personal deep dive into an emotional ride with various hard hitting stakes. </p>

<h3 class="center">Interstellar</h3>
<img src="interstellar.jpg" alt="a picture of the titular characters" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>In the not so far future, Earth is practically on its last legs. In a last ditch effort, NASA assmebles a team to travel through space to fluke their way to finding another planet to help humanity survive. Masterfully weaving both science and feeling in a larger than life film.</p>

<h3 class="center">Logan</h3>
<img src="logan.jpg" alt="a picture of Logan on the ground with armed soldiers aiming at him" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">

Taking care of a Professor X who has been suffering with Alzheimers they come across a young clone named Laura. Followed by evil forces Logan makes his way across the country to help protect the last shining light of mutantkind. </p>

<h3 class="center">Avengers Infinity War</h3>

The heroes band together on Earth and in deep space as they scramble to form a final resistance against the oncoming darkness.</p>

<h3 class="center">The Batman</h3>
<img src="Batman.jpeg" alt="A picture of commisioner Gordon pushing back Batman" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>A couple years into Bruce's portrayal of Batman, he uncovers a plan to eliminate Gothams most prominent, ultimately leading back to himself. Set in a very gritty and gothic Gotham city, it provides a very personal look on Bruce Wayne and how he percieves his role in the world around him, constantly interacting with a diverse set of characters and solving the mystery of the Riddler. </p>

<h3 class="center">Jurassic World Dominion</h3>
<img src="GigaIan.jpg" alt="a picture of Ian Malcom waving a stick on fire in front of a Giganatosaurus" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>After releasing dinosaurs on to the mainland in the previous films, the floodgates of genetic potential have been unleashed. A film that unites characters from the current Jurassic World movies and legacy characters from the orignal Jurassic Park films the dinosaur action is pushed to the absolute max in stunning locations.</p>

<h3 class="center">F9</h3>
<img src="F9.JPG" alt="an image of Dom and Roman shooting guns" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>A film on how the titular characters explore what family means to them as Dominic Toretto's younger brother returns with a vengeance. More mind-blowing action and bonkers drama as a large amount of former cast unites to push this movie to the extreme.</p>
