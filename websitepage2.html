<h1>TV Shows</h1>
<p>TV shows and other long form series provide a sense of natural build up. This allows for more time being spent on aspects like character build up and emotional plot beats. The overall longer runtime and extended release schedule allows for a more staggered and longer hype period. </p>

<h2>My favourite TV Shows</h2>

<h3 class="center">Doctor Who</h3>
<img src="doctorwho.jpg" alt="The Doctor, Yaz and Dan stand outside the TARDIS" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>The Dotor, a time lord travels through time and space, meeting many different bigger than life characters and having a variety of wonderful adventures against fearsome foes. </p>

<h3 class="center">Daredevil</h3>

<p>Matthew Murdock leads a very intriguing double life, a lawyer by day but vigilante by night. Using his enhanced senses and incredible fighting skills Daredevil battles to do his best to help heal his city from the rot that is determined to consume it.</p>

<h3 class="center">Legion</h3>
<img src="Legion.jpg" alt="A wavey picture of Legion" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>A show that constantly makes you question the reality around you. Following David Haller, a mutant with schizophrenia and reality warping powers, the show constantly explores different psychological and philosphical debates as David tries to find his place in the universe.</p>

<h3 class="center">Pokemon</h3>
<img src="pokemon.png" alt="Ash with Pikachu on his shoulder pointing" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<p>Ash Ketchum wants to be the very best, like no one ever was. With his trusty partner Pikachu, Ash travels the Pokemon world and catches and trains many Pokemon to battle in different Pokemon gyms and leagues to prove himself.</p>

<h3 class="center">The Boys</h3> 
<img src="theboiz.png" alt="a bloody Homelander" width="20%" height="50%" class="center">
<P>A world where superhumans are not afraid to abuse the power imbued in them. Full to the brim with blood, gore and satire on all aspects of our world whether corporate or political. The show follows a group of vigilantes, all having been hurt from the Supes one way or the other as they hunt down and try their best to eliminate them. The premier hero is Homelander, a corrupted version of Superman who tries his best to prove himself as the best among them.</P>
